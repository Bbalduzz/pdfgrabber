# What is this?
This vendor-agnostic script is used to download pdfs (and covers) from different services.
# State of features
Every downloader has different features that might also be implemented in the future. As of now, there is a way to download best-quality pdf from every one of them, with varying degree of quality, speed and discretion. Here's a table riassuming all the features.

Apps that I am aware of but I can't work with beacuse I don't have books:
 - Raffaello player
 - Appbook (might be a shitty html webview like booktab)

## TODO
 - Add anonymous user
 - Add ability to pass options to scripts
 - Add page labels and perfect token checks
 - General code quality improvement (better management of exceptions)
 - Use pathlib for better windows compatibility

# Installation
You need python 3.6+. To install all the requirements run ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```. Also the script has been tested only on mac os, contact me if you have tried it on linux/windows or you have problems.
## Kitaboo/Reader+ books
For kitaboo books the script uses selenium and a chrome webdriver instance to rendere the html pages. It might also not work at all on windows, I haven't had the opportunity to try it. To configure it, go to ```lib.py``` and change the two paths at the beginning of the file, one for the chromedriver executable path, the other with the chrome binary path.
# How to use it
Just run ```python3 main.py```. You first need to create an account by selecting *r* in the first menu. After you created an account, select *d* and the menus will guide you. The output file will be ```files/<service>/<id>.pdf```
