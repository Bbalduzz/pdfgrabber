# What is this?
This vendor-agnostic script is used to download pdfs (and covers) from different services.
# State of features
Every downloader has different features that might also be implemented in the future. As of now, there is a way to download best-quality pdf from every one of them, with varying degree of quality, speed and discretion. Here's a table riassuming all the features.

| service | pdf download | table of contents | pdf size | max logins | page labels | login expire | cover | rendered |
| ------- | :----------: | :---------------: | :------: | :--------: | :---------: | :----------: | :---: | :-----: |
| Scuolabook | perfect | yes (very small) | excellent | very restrictive | yes | never | yes | no |
| MyLim | perfect | excellent | excellent | no | not yet/depends on vendor | ? | yes | no |
| Pearson eText | perfect | (depends on vendor)/excellent | big | no | no/depends on vendor | very fast (30 min) | yes | sometimes |

Apps that I am aware of but I can't work with beacuse I don't have books:
 - ~~Raffaello player~~ Done
 - Appbook (might be a shitty html webview like booktab)

## TODO
 - Add anonymous user
 - ~~Add ability to pass options to scripts~~
 - Add ~~page labels~~ and "perfect" token checks
 - General code quality improvement (better management of exceptions)
 - ~~Use pathlib for better windows compatibility~~

# Quirks
## Kitaboo/Reader+ books
For kitaboo and RPLUS_EPUB books the script uses playwright (chromium automation) to render the html pages. You might want to issue ```playwright install chromium``` to download chroium. No forther setup is needed.
## Scuolabook
Scuolabook has a very strict login system, where you can have only 2 devices logged in and you only have 2 deletions per year. This means that you can only log in 4 times every year, with no way of downloading books (at least, the pdf version) if you have hit this limit. pdfgrabber should save the token for you, but you should also keep it somewhere safer such as a text document. 
## Pearson
Pearon has a terrible double-service combo, eText and Reader+. Their login system is a gigantic mess, so the tokens expire very quickly (the ability to refresh them still needs to be implemented). This isn't too big of a problem in practice, since the you have unlimited logins. If your login fails even though you are sure your username and password are right, then it means that you need to accept the terms & privacy policy for one of the two services. Just download the Reader+ app and log in once. It will ask to accept the terms & conditions. 
If the download of an eText book gets stuck in loop where it infinitely tries to download, then that is a problem with too strict caching policies from pearson's servers. It is problematic even for the official app, where it just spits out an error. Just try again later ;-)
Both RPLUS_PDF and RPLUS_EPUB books are stored in a password protected zip file. Python's ZipFile module doesn't do the decryption natively, so it might take a (very) long time for some big books in the "Extracting zip" phase. If you have found a decent workaround let me know.
# How to use it
Just run ```python3 main.py```. You first need to create an account by selecting *r* in the first menu. After you created an account, select *d* and the menus will guide you. The output file will be ```files/<service>/<id>.pdf```
